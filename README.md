# QuantumComputingExperiments
Experimenting with QC and QM simulations, mostly in Strawberry Fields and Qiskit.

Currently, it only contains one, simple-to-medium complexity Quantum Optical Circuit in Strawberry Fields (I was just testing what it can do, circuit doesn't do anything useful aside of generating quantum state which I think looks interestingly); and one script that can actually be useful for anyone in the field of QM, which generates real-valued, 1D square integrable function – and that's something I'll definitely expand sooner or later, by turning it into standalone app, adding complex valued function generation, extending it to more spataial dimension (2D, 3D) or to include variation over time, and finally I **may** port it onto some SBCs (RPi, OrangePi, Radxa, Libre Computer, whatever can handle it).

Stay tuned. Any contributions welcome, asd long as you ask me before.
